                    <p><img src="img/IMG_9060.jpg" class="img_section" alt="Stacy Lau in Hong Kong">My name is Stacy Lau and I'm currently enrolled in two CIS classes at College of San Mateo. I have taken a variety of courses at CSM over the past thirty years, even receiving a certificate in mulitmedia from CSM in the early 2000's. No, I am not young but have been dedicated to lifelong learning. I have lived in California for almost my entire life. I reside with my husband of ten years and three cats in San Mateo. I am on a career break--I thank a relative for giving me this term to use, because it sounds better than saying I'm underemployed or unemployed. I am at a crossroads in my life, trying to decide what I'd like to do for the next twenty years. I have been in a web-related career for the past twenty years, working in marketing, web production and development. I have experience working on corporate websites and handling marketing email campaigns, from creation to deployment. While my career up until now has been focused more towards production, design, and marketing, I would like to move in a more technical direction.</p>
                    <p>I'm taking this Mobile Web App Development course because I'd like to review this topic and refine my skills in this area. I'm hoping that I can use what I learn for my next job or to expand my career options.</p>
